# BIG-Integers
Adding BIG Integers
In C++ an int is in the range 0 to 65535. But what if we need to add larger integers? 
Say we want compute the sum 2345566777844567+ 9999988777765768009998. 
Write a function
string add(string a, string b)
where a and b are strings representing integers and the function add(a,b) returns a string representing their sum. 
Main program asks the user for the two numbers a and b snd their sum is returned
